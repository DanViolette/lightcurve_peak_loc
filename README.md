# lightcurve_peak_loc
Utilizes emcee Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) package to investigate aperiodic peaks in photometric light curve data. This package utilizes Bayesian inference to localize potential events in lightcurve data by accepting photometric count rates, errors, and times and fitting for potential peak structure. By marginalizing over peak shape and baseline brightness, the package return estimates of significant peak signals' amplitudes and peak timings.
